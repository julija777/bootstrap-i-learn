# bootstrap-i-learn
I learn how to build responsive websites with Bootstrap, and use its included classes to style buttons, images, forms, navigation, and other common elements. Also playing with other JS libraries as jquery, SASS, redux, react in this repo.

I have learned:

-> One feature of Sass that's different than CSS is it uses variables. They are declared and set to store data, similar to JavaScript.

-> If you use the create-react-app in your project, you can easily install and use Sass in your React projects.

    Install Sass by running this command in your terminal:
    >npm i sass
    Now you are ready to include Sass files in your project!
